# Story 2.1: MCP Server Setup & Health Check
# Acceptance Criteria:
# 1. Given the coretext daemon is running
# 2. When the Gemini CLI checks /health
# 3. Then the server responds with a 200 OK status.
# 4. And the server binds only to 127.0.0.1.
# 5. And the server exposes an MCP endpoint pattern like /mcp/tools/{tool_name}.
