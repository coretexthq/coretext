# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**
The core functionality revolves around parsing BMAD Markdown files into a structured Knowledge Graph, which is stored in SurrealDB. This graph is kept in sync with Git repositories via pre-commit hooks, allowing for versioning based on Git commit hashes. The system provides robust mechanisms for enforcing referential integrity and reporting malformed Markdown syntax. A key functional aspect is the ability to serve precise, topologically relevant context to AI agents via a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, abstracting complex graph traversals into semantic queries. This includes CLI tools for system management, status checks, inspection, and linting.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
Performance is critical, with strict latency targets for Git synchronization (sub-second for incremental commits) and MCP queries (sub-500ms RTT). If sync operations exceed thresholds, the system must transition to an asynchronous background mode to avoid blocking user workflow. Scalability mandates support for large repositories (up to 10,000 files) and dense graphs (100,000+ edges) on standard hardware. Reliability is ensured through a "Fail-Open" policy for Git hooks and self-healing mechanisms for graph integrity (e.g., pruning dangling edges). Security is paramount, with a "Local-First" data policy, opt-in metadata-only telemetry, and strict database isolation.

**Scale & Complexity:**

- Primary domain: AI & Knowledge Management Developer Tool
- Complexity level: High (due to hybrid search architecture, AST-based parsing, deterministic state synchronization, and knowledge engineering for AI reliability)
- Estimated architectural components: The system will require components for AST parsing, Git hook integration, SurrealDB management, MCP server implementation, CLI interface, and potentially a VS Code extension in later phases.

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

The system is built upon the BMAD Method for data protocol, using file paths as unique IDs and standard Markdown links for graph edges. SurrealDB is the chosen storage engine, serving as a unified store for content, vectors, and graph topology, with a strict SurrealQL pattern. The runtime environment leverages Gemini CLI extensions, with a decoupled design comprising an independent Python/SurrealDB Core Daemon and a thin Gemini CLI Extension client. A custom MCP Server is required to abstract SurrealQL complexities into semantic tools for AI agent consumption. The workspace structure mandates separate directories for BMAD managed (`/.bmad/`), Coretext managed (`/.coretext/`), and shared documentation (`/docs/`). Model selection is constrained to quantized, CPU-optimized embedding models.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

Key cross-cutting concerns include ensuring **State Determinism** (Knowledge Graph as a deterministic projection of the file system), maintaining **Strict Schema, Loud Failures** (no fuzzy parsing, clear error reporting for malformed input), ensuring **Referential Integrity** (validating links and dependencies), optimizing **Performance** (sync and query latencies), managing **Resource Caps** (memory and CPU usage), implementing **Security** (local-first data handling), - handling **Semantic Chunking via Header-Node Topology**:

    **Root Node:** The File itself (id = file_path).
    **Child Nodes:** Every Markdown Header (#, ##, ###) creates a distinct Graph Node.
    **Relationships:**
        - `CONTAINS`: File -> Header.
        - `PARENT_OF`: H1 -> H2.
    **Content Storage:** Text under a header belongs to that Header Node.
    This explicit strategy allows agents to retrieve specific sections (e.g., 'Section 3.1') without processing the entire file, directly preventing implementation errors related to context retrieval.

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

Python Monolith (Daemon/MCP Server) with Thin Gemini CLI Client.

### Starter Options Considered

Based on the strict requirements for an **AI-Native Stack** (Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typer, SurrealDB), a generic starter template is not suitable. Instead, we will define a **Custom "AI-Native" Scaffold** that enforces these specific constraints.

The research focused on best practices for integrating FastAPI (for the MCP/Daemon layer) with Typer (for the CLI layer) in a single Python package, while strictly adhering to the "No Docker" and "Local-First" constraints.

### Selected Strategy: Custom AI-Native Scaffold

**Rationale for Selection:**
Generic starters often include Docker, heavy frontend frameworks, or complex ORMs (like SQLAlchemy/Postgres) that conflict with the coretext "Local-First" and "Embedded SurrealDB" philosophy. A custom scaffold ensures we only include the exact libraries needed for high-performance AST parsing and Graph interactions, minimizing the "context noise" for AI agents.

**Initialization Command:**

```bash
# Manual scaffolding plan for the first implementation story:
poetry new coretext
cd coretext
poetry add "fastapi[standard]" typer pydantic surrealdb python-multipart uvicorn gitpython sentence-transformers
```

**Architectural Decisions Provided by Custom Scaffold:**

**Language & Runtime:**
- **Python 3.10+**: Mandatory for modern type hinting (PEP 604 `X | Y`) which Pydantic v2 leverages heavily for schema validation.
- **Monorepo-ish Structure**: A single Python package `coretext/` containing both `cli/` (Typer) and `server/` (FastAPI) modules.

**Styling Solution:**
- **Rich**: Used by Typer for beautiful, colored CLI output (critical for "Loud Failures").

**Build Tooling:**
- **Poetry**: For strict dependency management and packaging.

**Testing Framework:**
- **Pytest**: Standard for Python.
- **Pytest-Asyncio**: Essential for testing FastAPI endpoints and SurrealDB async drivers.

**Code Organization:**
- `coretext/core/`: The "Brain" (AST Parsing, Graph Logic).
- `coretext/server/`: The "Interface" (MCP Server using FastAPI).
- `coretext/cli/`: The "Controller" (Typer commands).
- `coretext/db/`: SurrealDB connection management and schema definitions.

**Development Experience:**
- **Local-First**: No Docker. `coretext init` will download the platform-specific `surreal` binary to `~/.coretext/bin`.
- **Type Safety**: Strict usage of Pydantic v2 for all data moving between Files <-> DB <-> API.

**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
- **Vector Embedding Model:** MRL capabilities for flexible storage/retrieval.
- **Graph Schema Strategy:** Decoupling internal DB schema from external BMAD template changes.
- **Migration Strategy:** Automated handling of schema changes in a local-first environment.
- **MCP Authentication:** Ensuring secure but frictionless local connection.

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
- **Daemon Lifecycle:** Robust process management without OS-specific service managers.
- **IPC Mechanism:** Communication between CLI and Daemon.

### Data Architecture

**Vector Embedding Model**
- **Decision:** `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (Local/ONNX version).
- **Version:** v1.5
- **Rationale:** Provides Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) natively, allowing optimization of storage and retrieval flexibility without cloud dependency (Project Constraint: Local-First/Offline).
- **Implementation Note:** Embeddings are generated in the Python Daemon using `sentence-transformers` and `nomic`, not SurrealDB's built-in SurrealML engine. This approach enables dynamic Matryoshka (MRL) truncation in Python before storage and simplifies local binary dependency management.
- **Reference:** [Nomic Embed Text v1.5](https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1-5)

**Graph Schema Strategy ("Schema Projection")**
- **Decision:** Decoupled "Schema Projection" layer.
- **Rationale:** Mitigates risk of "Schema Drift" caused by updates to the `.bmad` template folder.
- **Implementation:**
    - **Internal Schema:** Rigid Pydantic Models (e.g., `class Epic(BaseNode)`) defining the "Ideal State".
    - **Mapping:** `schema_map.yaml` in `.coretext/` maps external Markdown headers (BMAD) to internal DB properties.
- **Reference:** [Pydantic Models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/)

**Migration Strategy**
- **Decision:** Automatic Schema Application on Startup.
- **Rationale:** As a local-first developer tool, users should not perform manual DB migrations. The daemon automatically aligns the SurrealDB schema with the current code version.
- **Reference:** [SurrealDB Schema Definition](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/statements/define)

### Authentication & Security

**MCP Authentication**
- **Decision:** Localhost Binding Only (127.0.0.1).
- **Rationale:** Reduces friction for the MVP of a single-user, local tool. Security relies on strict OS-level file permissions and network isolation.

**Daemon Permissions**
- **Decision:** Inherit User Permissions.
- **Rationale:** The daemon runs as the user, limiting its access to files the user can already see/modify.

### API & Communication Patterns

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
- **Decision:** HTTP Health Check + PID File.
- **Rationale:** Simple, cross-platform reliability. CLI reads `.coretext/daemon.pid` to check process existence and pings `http://localhost:<port>/health` for status.

**MCP Tool Design**
- **Decision:** Semantic Tool Abstraction.
- **Rationale:** MCP Server wraps complex SurrealQL queries into high-level tools (e.g., `search_topology`, `get_dependencies`), protecting the Agent from raw SQL.
- **Reference:** [Model Context Protocol Concepts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts)

### Infrastructure & Deployment

**Daemon Lifecycle Management**
- **Decision:** Custom `coretext init` script managing `surreal` binary.
- **Rationale:** Downloads standalone binary to `~/.coretext/bin/`, avoiding Docker dependency and simplifying updates.
- **Reference:** [SurrealDB Installation](https://surrealdb.com/docs/installation)

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**
1.  **Scaffold:** Initialize Poetry project with `fastapi`, `typer`, `surrealdb`, `nomic`.
2.  **Schema:** Define Pydantic models for `Epic`, `Story`, `File` and the `schema_map.yaml` parser.
3.  **DB Layer:** Implement SurrealDB connection and migration logic (using strict SurrealQL).
4.  **Daemon:** Build FastAPI app with MCP endpoints and embedding logic.
5.  **CLI:** Implement `coretext init`, `start`, `status` commands using Typer.

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**
- The **Schema Projection** heavily influences the **AST Parser** logic in the Daemon.
- **Daemon Lifecycle** dictates how the **CLI** detects and manages the background process.

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**
5 areas where AI agents could make different choices: Naming, Structure, Format, Process, and Documentation.

### Naming Patterns

**Database Naming Conventions:**
- **Snake Case:** All database tables and fields must use `snake_case` (e.g., `user_account`, `created_at`) to align with Python/Pydantic standards and minimize serialization issues.

**API Naming Conventions:**
- **MCP Tools:** Routes must be structured as `/mcp/tools/{tool_name}` (e.g., `/mcp/tools/search_topology`) to explicitly map to MCP definitions.
- **Plural Nouns:** Standard REST endpoints (if any) should use plural nouns (e.g., `/epics`).

**Code Naming Conventions:**
- **Files:** `snake_case.py` (Standard Python).
- **Variables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `user_id`).
- **Classes:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `GraphManager`).

### Structure Patterns

**Project Organization:**
- **Domain-Driven:** Models and schemas are co-located by domain (e.g., `coretext/core/epics/models.py` contains both DB and API models).
- **Tests:** Located in a `tests/` folder at the root, mirroring the package structure.

**File Structure Patterns:**
- **Configuration:** `config.yaml` (or similar) in `.coretext/`.
- **Binaries:** `~/.coretext/bin/` for the `surreal` executable.

### Format Patterns

**API Response Formats:**
- **Internal MCP:** Direct data return (e.g., `List[Epic]`) to simplify parsing for the Agent.
- **Errors:** Standard FastAPI `HTTPException` with `{"detail": "message"}` JSON body.

**Data Exchange Formats:**
- **JSON:** Standard JSON serialization for all API responses.

### Communication Patterns

**Event System Patterns:**
- **Not Applicable:** Direct function calls and HTTP requests are used for this architecture.

**State Management Patterns:**
- **Graph Updates:** **"Upsert by Path"**. Agents must use `UPDATE` or `INSERT` logic based on file path ID.
- **Gatekeeper:** All DB writes must go through the `GraphManager` class.

### Process Patterns

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- **FastAPI Standards:** Raise `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes.
- **Loud Failures:** CLI should report errors clearly to the user.

**Loading State Patterns:**
- **CLI:** Show spinners or progress bars during long-running operations (e.g., sync).

### Documentation Patterns

**Documentation as Code:**
- **Pydantic:** Every model field MUST have a `description`.
- **FastAPI Routes:** Every route function MUST have a docstring with example inputs/outputs. These are parsed to generate MCP Tool definitions.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI Agents MUST:**
- Follow the `snake_case` convention.
- Use the `GraphManager` for all DB writes.
- Include docstrings for all API routes.
- Adhere to the "Upsert by Path" logic.

**Pattern Enforcement:**
- **Code Review:** Human review of generated code.
- **Linting:** Use `ruff` or similar tools to enforce style.
- **Tests:** Unit tests should verify that patterns are followed (e.g., checking for docstrings).

### Pattern Examples

**Good Examples:**
```python
# Good: Explicit route, docstring, snake_case
@app.get("/mcp/tools/search_topology")
async def search_topology(query: str):
    """
    Searches the knowledge graph for topological connections.

    Args:
        query: Natural language query string.

    Returns:
        List[Node]: A list of relevant graph nodes.
    """
    return await graph_manager.search(query)
```

**Anti-Patterns:**
```python
# Bad: Vague route, no docstring, raw SQL
@app.get("/search")
async def do_search(q):
    # ... raw sql ...
```

### Architectural Boundaries

**API Boundaries:**
- **External (CLI/Agent):** `coretext/server/mcp/routes.py` handles incoming requests from Gemini CLI and Agents.
- **Internal (Domain):** `coretext/core/` exposes clean Python interfaces to the Server layer. The Server layer NEVER calls DB directly.

**Component Boundaries:**
- **CLI:** Purely a UI layer. It communicates with the running Daemon via HTTP (or spawns it). It does NOT contain business logic.
- **Daemon (Server + Core):** Holds all state and logic.

**Data Boundaries:**
- **SurrealDB:** Accessed ONLY via `coretext/db/client.py` wrapper, controlled by `GraphManager`.
- **File System:** `coretext/core/sync/` is the only module allowed to read raw Markdown files from disk.

### Requirements to Structure Mapping

**Feature/Epic Mapping:**
- **Epic: Knowledge Graph** → `coretext/core/graph/`, `coretext/db/`
- **Epic: Synchronization** → `coretext/core/sync/`
- **Epic: Agent Interface** → `coretext/server/mcp/`

**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**
- **Performance:** `coretext/core/vector/` (Embedding handling)
- **Configuration:** `coretext/config.py`

### Integration Points

**Internal Communication:**
- **CLI -> Daemon:** HTTP requests to `http://localhost:{port}`.
- **Daemon -> DB:** WebSocket/HTTP via `surrealdb` python client.

**External Integrations:**
- **Git:** `gitpython` usage within `coretext/core/sync/engine.py`.

### File Organization Patterns

**Configuration Files:**
- User-editable config lives in `.coretext/`.
- System defaults live in `coretext/config.py`.

**Source Organization:**
- **Monorepo-style:** Clear separation of concerns (`cli` vs `server` vs `core`) within a single package.

**Test Organization:**
- **Mirrored:** `tests/unit/core/graph/test_manager.py` tests `coretext/core/graph/manager.py`.

### Development Workflow Integration

**Development Server Structure:**
- `uvicorn` running `coretext.server.app:app` with reload enabled.

**Build Process Structure:**
- `poetry build` packages the entire `coretext` directory.

**Deployment Structure:**
- `pip install coretext` installs the CLI. `coretext init` sets up the local environment (DB binary, config).
