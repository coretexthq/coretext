**Dependencies**: None. This epic establishes the core system.

### Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Core Scaffolding

As a developer, I want to initialize the `coretext` project environment, so that I have the core scaffold and dependencies in place to begin development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given I am in the project root directory
*   When I run the initial scaffolding commands
*   Then a Poetry project named `coretext` is created.
*   And `fastapi[standard]`, `typer`, `pydantic`, `surrealdb`, `python-multipart`, `uvicorn`, `gitpython`, `sentence-transformers` are added as dependencies.
*   And the basic project structure (`cli/`, `server/`, `core/`, `db/`) is laid out as defined in Architecture.md.
*   And a `gemini-extension.json` manifest file is created at the root level for Gemini CLI integration (replacing the deprecated extension.yaml).

**Technical Notes:**
*   Run `poetry new coretext` and `poetry add ...` commands.
*   Create empty `__init__.py` files for package structure.
*   Setup `pyproject.toml` with basic project metadata.
*   Create `gemini-extension.json` defining the tool entry point and MCP server configuration.

**Prerequisites:** None.

### Story 1.2: SurrealDB Management & Schema Application

As a `coretext` system, I want to manage a local SurrealDB instance and apply the graph schema automatically, so that the knowledge graph has a persistent and structured storage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the `coretext` project is initialized
*   When `coretext init` is executed
*   Then the platform-specific `surreal` binary is downloaded to `~/.coretext/bin/`.
*   And a `surreal.db` file is created or found in `.coretext/`.
*   And the user is prompted to start the daemon immediately ("Do you want to start the coretext daemon now? [Y/n]").
*   And on daemon startup, the SurrealDB schema (defined by Pydantic models mapped via `schema_map.yaml`) is automatically applied.
*   And `GraphManager` class is implemented to be the sole gatekeeper for DB writes.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement `coretext/db/client.py` for SurrealDB connection.
*   Implement `coretext/db/migrations.py` for schema definition and application logic.
*   Implement `coretext/core/graph/manager.py` with methods for basic node/edge operations (create/read/update/delete).
*   Define Pydantic models for core graph entities (e.g., `Node`, `Edge`).
*   Implement logic for `schema_map.yaml` to map BMAD concepts to internal DB schema.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.1.

### Story 1.3: BMAD Markdown Parsing to Graph Nodes

As the `coretext` system, I want to parse BMAD-flavored Markdown files, so that their content can be transformed into structured graph nodes and stored in SurrealDB.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given a BMAD-flavored Markdown file (`.md`) is provided
*   When the parsing engine processes the file
*   Then the file itself is represented as a Root Node (ID=`file_path`). (FR1)
*   And every Markdown header (`#`, `##`, `###`) creates a distinct Graph Node with `CONTAINS` relationship from the file. (FR1)
*   And content under a header is stored as a property of its corresponding Header Node. (FR1)
*   And malformed Markdown syntax results in a "Parsing Error" Node and a rejected update, with the error reported. (FR7)

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement `coretext/core/parser/markdown.py` with AST parsing logic.
*   Define logic to identify headers, content sections, and map them to graph nodes.
*   Integrate parsing with `GraphManager` to store nodes in SurrealDB.
*   Implement error handling for malformed Markdown.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.2.

### Story 1.4: Git Repository Change Detection & Synchronization

As a developer, I want my local Markdown changes to be automatically synchronized with the `coretext` knowledge graph upon Git commit, so that the graph always reflects the latest project state without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given `coretext` is initialized and configured
*   When I make changes to Markdown files within the Git repository
*   And I execute `git commit`
*   Then the `sync.py` pre-commit Git hook detects the changes. (FR2, FR13)
*   And the system processes only the changed Markdown files. (FR3)
*   And the corresponding graph nodes in SurrealDB are updated or created. (FR3, FR4)
*   And the Knowledge Graph state is versioned with the Git commit hash. (FR5)
*   And the hook completes within 1 second for typical commits (1-5 files). (FR14, FR20)

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement `coretext/core/sync/engine.py` for Git hook logic (using `gitpython`).
*   Develop mechanism to detect changed files.
*   Integrate with `markdown.py` parser and `graph/manager.py` for syncing to DB.
*   Implement versioning strategy using Git commit hashes.
*   Implement performance monitoring for the sync process.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.3.

### Story 1.5: Referential Integrity & Link Validation

As a `coretext` system, I want to enforce referential integrity within the knowledge graph, so that all links and dependencies between documents are valid and consistent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given Markdown files contain Standard Markdown Links (`[Label](./path)`)
*   When the parsing and synchronization process runs
*   Then these links are represented as `PARENT_OF` edges between graph nodes (e.g., H1 -> H2). (FR6)
*   And `coretext` verifies that linked paths exist as valid graph nodes. (FR6)
*   And "Dangling Reference" warnings are triggered during a "dry-run" linting phase before commit (via `coretext lint` or similar mechanism). (FR6)

**Technical Notes:**
*   Enhance `coretext/core/parser/markdown.py` to identify and extract Standard Markdown Links.
*   Modify `coretext/core/graph/manager.py` to create and manage graph edges for these links.
*   Implement validation logic within `coretext/core/sync/engine.py` or a dedicated linter (`coretext/cli/commands.py`) to check for existence of linked nodes.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.4.

### Story 1.6: Epic 1 Demo & Verification Fixes

As a user (Minh), I want a verified, end-to-end demo guide for Epic 1, along with the necessary system fixes to make it work, so that I can confidently validate the core knowledge graph functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the system is built
*   When I follow `docs/epic-1-demo-guide.md`
*   Then I can successfully initialize, start, sync, verify, and stop the system.
*   And the `coretext stop` command exists.
*   And edge creation works without schema errors.

**Technical Notes:**

**Prerequisites:** Epic 1 (all stories).

### Story 2.2: Semantic Tool for Topology Search

As an AI agent, I want a semantic tool to search the knowledge graph for topological connections, so that I can understand project structure and dependencies relevant to my task.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the MCP server is running and the graph contains data
*   When the AI agent calls `POST /mcp/tools/search_topology` with a query
*   Then `coretext` uses `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` for query embedding.
*   And `coretext` performs a vector similarity search in SurrealDB.
*   And `coretext` traverses graph relationships to find topologically relevant nodes. (FR10)
*   And `coretext` returns a list of relevant graph nodes (files, headers, entities) as context. (FR11)

**Technical Notes:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the MCP server is running and the graph contains data
*   When the AI agent calls `POST /mcp/tools/get_dependencies` with a node identifier (e.g., file path, header ID)
*   Then `coretext` traverses `depends_on`, `governed_by`, or `PARENT_OF` edges in the graph. (FR12)
*   And `coretext` returns a structured list of dependent nodes and their relationships. (FR11)
*   And the tool is implemented to handle different types of relationships as defined in the graph schema.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Extend `coretext/core/graph/manager.py` with methods for graph traversal and dependency retrieval.
*   Implement `coretext/server/mcp/routes.py` with the `get_dependencies` endpoint.
*   Ensure the tool can accept various node identifiers and return consistent results.

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.2.

### Story 2.4: MCP Protocol Adherence & Documentation

As a `coretext` system, I want to strictly adhere to the MCP protocol and generate accurate tool definitions, so that AI agents can reliably discover and utilize its capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the MCP server is running
*   When an AI agent inspects the server's capabilities
*   Then all exposed MCP tools (`search_topology`, `get_dependencies`, etc.) are well-documented with docstrings and example I/O. (FR9)
*   And the server generates a valid MCP manifest defining all available tools.
*   And the API adheres to the standard `HTTPException` for errors.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Ensure all FastAPI routes for MCP tools have comprehensive docstrings and Pydantic models for request/response.

**Technical Context**:
*   **Architecture**: Robust Daemon lifecycle management, resource caps (memory, CPU priority), "Fail-Open" policy for Git hooks, self-healing routines for graph integrity (e.g., pruning dangling edges).
*   **Implementation**: Asynchronous operations (`async/await`), optimized embedding generation, efficient SurrealDB query execution, `gitpython` for Git interaction.
*   **Project Structure**: Performance considerations integrated across `coretext/core/sync/`, `coretext/server/`, `coretext/db/`, and `coretext/core/vector/`.

**UX Integration**: Invisible background operation that ensures no blocking of Git commits and rapid AI agent query responses.

**Dependencies**: Epic 1 (Core Knowledge Graph Foundation), Epic 2 (Agent Context Retrieval).

### Story 4.1: Git Hook Async Mode & Fail-Open Policy

As a developer, I want `coretext`'s Git hook to operate efficiently without blocking my `git commit` operations, even for large changes or in case of internal errors, so that my workflow remains uninterrupted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the `sync.py` Git hook is active
*   When an incremental sync is predicted to exceed 2 seconds (or configured threshold)
*   Then the `sync.py` hook automatically detaches and switches to Background Async Mode. (FR21)
*   And `git commit` completes immediately.
*   And if `sync.py` encounters a crash, it logs the error and displays a non-blocking warning to the user, allowing `git commit` to proceed.
*   And `coretext` never blocks the user's work due to an internal tool error.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement logic within `coretext/core/sync/engine.py` to predict sync duration and trigger async mode.
*   Develop a mechanism for `sync.py` to gracefully detach and run in the background (e.g., using `subprocess.Popen`).
*   Implement robust error handling and logging within `sync.py` for the "Fail-Open" policy.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.4.

### Story 4.2: MCP Query Latency Optimization

As an AI agent, I want `coretext` to respond to my context queries quickly, so that my "thinking" phase remains fluid and efficient.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed graph data.

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.2, Story 2.3.

### Story 4.3: Resource Consumption Management

As a developer, I want `coretext` to be a "good neighbor" on my local machine, consuming minimal system resources, so that it doesn't negatively impact the performance of other applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the `coretext` daemon is running
*   When idle, the daemon consumes less than 50MB RAM. (FR23)
*   And background embedding operations run at the lowest process priority (`nice -n 19` on Unix-like systems). (FR24)

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement memory profiling for the daemon and optimize Python object handling.
*   Use `psutil` or similar libraries to set process priority for background tasks.
*   Ensure `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` is configured for CPU-optimized inference.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.4, Story 2.2.

### Story 4.4: Graph Self-Healing & Integrity Checks

As a `coretext` system, I want to automatically maintain the integrity of the knowledge graph, so that broken links and outdated nodes don't accumulate and degrade its accuracy over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the `coretext` daemon starts up
*   When the system initializes
*   Then a self-heal routine runs that scans for and automatically prunes "Dangling Edges" (links to deleted files or nodes).
*   And `coretext` reports any significant graph integrity issues in the logs.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement a routine within `coretext/core/graph/manager.py` to identify and remove dangling edges.
*   Integrate this routine into the daemon's startup sequence (`coretext/server/app.py`).
*   Utilize SurrealDB's query capabilities to efficiently identify inconsistent data.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.5.

## Epic 5: Release Readiness & Gap Analysis

**User Value Statement**: Users receive a fully polished, verified, and complete product, as the system undergoes a comprehensive end-to-end review and gap closure process before final release.

**Dependencies**: Epics 1-4.

### Story 5.1: Comprehensive Product Demo & Verification Guide

As a Product Owner, I want a comprehensive demo guide covering all features from Epics 1-4, so that I can systematically verify the entire system's functionality and user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the system is built
*   When I access `docs/release-demo-guide.md`
*   Then it covers: Project Init, Database Sync, Agent Context Retrieval (MCP), CLI Tools, and Reliability features.
*   And it includes step-by-step instructions and expected outcomes.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Create `docs/release-demo-guide.md`.
*   Aggregate existing demo steps from previous Epics.
*   Add verification steps for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., latency, error handling).

**Prerequisites:** Epics 1-4.

### Story 5.2: Gap Analysis & Closure (Directory Selection & Fixes)

As a Developer using CoreText, I want to identify and close gaps in the product's features, so that the system is fully ready for release.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the `release-demo-guide.md` exists
*   When I execute the guide and identify gaps
*   Then the system is updated with missing features (e.g., `docs_dir` scoping).

*   And the Knowledge Graph integrity is verified via the demo guide.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement `docs_dir` configuration.
*   Resolve SurrealDB connection and port stability issues.
*   Fix Vector Embedding generation and safety checks.
*   Execute and verify the demo guide.

### Story 5.3: Hybrid Execution & Thick Tool Implementation

As an AI Agent, I want a single "Thick Tool" named `query_knowledge` that combines semantic search with graph traversal, so that I can retrieve deep, topologically connected context from a simple natural language query without needing to chain multiple tools or write complex database queries ("Thin Prompt").

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the MCP server is running
*   When the Agent calls `query_knowledge(natural_query="...", depth=1)`
*   Then the system vectorizes the `natural_query`.
*   And identifies "Anchor Nodes" via vector similarity search in SurrealDB.
*   And automatically traverses the graph from these anchors (e.g., `depends_on`, `child_of`) to gather context.
*   And returns a consolidated context object containing the relevant subgraph.
*   And this abstraction allows the Agent's system prompt to remain minimal.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement `query_knowledge` tool in `coretext/server/mcp/routes.py`.
*   Orchestrate the "Hybrid Execution" logic: Vector Embed -> Select Anchors -> Traverse Graph.
*   Ensure the response format is optimized for LLM consumption (reducing token usage while maximizing information density).
*   Verify protocol adherence is already satisfied (ignoring standard protocol re-checks as instructed).

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.2, Story 2.3.

### Story 5.4: Gemini CLI Integration & Extension Packaging

As a User, I want the CoreText MCP tools to be natively available in the Gemini CLI, so that I can interact with the knowledge graph naturally during my chat sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the CoreText project is ready
*   When I inspect `gemini-extension.json` (formerly extension.yaml)
*   Then it includes a `mcpServers` section defining the `coretext` server.
*   And the configuration correctly points to the running daemon/MCP server using proper command arguments.
*   When I ask the Gemini CLI "How does the graph manager work?", it invokes the `query_knowledge` tool transparently.
*   And the tool execution returns the context to the conversation.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Update `gemini-extension.json` to include the `tools` definition mapping to the MCP endpoints.
*   Ensure the CLI can discover and invoke the tools via the defined protocol.
*   Verify end-to-end functionality with a sample query in the CLI.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.3.

### Story 5.6: Gemini CLI Extension Manifest & Command Packaging

As a developer, I want to package CoreText as a standard Gemini CLI extension using a `gemini-extension.json` manifest and TOML commands, so that users can easily install and use the tool via the Gemini CLI.

**Context:**
Gemini CLI extensions package prompts, MCP servers, and custom commands.
- **Location**: `~/.gemini/extensions`
- **Manifest**: `gemini-extension.json` (defines name, version, mcpServers)
- **Commands**: `commands/*.toml` (custom reusable prompts)
- **Installation**: `gemini extensions link` (dev) or `install` (prod).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Given the CoreText project structure
*   When the extension is packaged
*   Then a `gemini-extension.json` manifest is created with:
    *   Correct `mcpServers` configuration (command, args, cwd) for the CoreText daemon.
    *   Metadata (name, version, description) matching project state.
*   And a `commands/` directory is created.
*   And an initial `commands/coretext.toml` is provided (e.g., for `init` or `status` prompts).
*   And the extension can be successfully linked using `gemini extensions link .`.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Implement a template or generator for `gemini-extension.json`.
*   Ensure `${extensionPath}` is used for portability in the manifest.
*   Verify command execution from the Gemini CLI after linking.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.4.
