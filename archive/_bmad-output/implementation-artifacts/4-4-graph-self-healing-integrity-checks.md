# Story 4.4: Graph Self-Healing & Integrity Checks

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a `coretext` system,
I want to automatically maintain the integrity of the knowledge graph,
so that broken links and outdated nodes don't accumulate and degrade its accuracy over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Automatic Pruning**: On system initialization (daemon startup), a self-healing routine automatically scans for and removes "Dangling Edges" (edges where the `in` or `out` node no longer exists).
2.  **Orphan Node Cleanup**: The routine identifies and archives or removes "Orphan Nodes" (nodes that are not file roots and have no incoming edges from a valid parent) if they are remnants of deleted content.
    *   *Refinement*: Be careful not to delete valid isolated nodes if the schema allows them. For now, focus on *Dangling Edges* as the primary integrity failure.
3.  **Startup Integration**: The healing process runs as a non-blocking background task during the daemon startup sequence (`lifespan` startup event).
4.  **Reporting**: Significant healing actions (e.g., "Pruned 50 dangling edges") are logged to the application logs (and visible in `coretext status` logs or similar if implemented).
5.  **Manual Trigger**: The healing routine can be triggered manually via an internal API call (to support future `coretext heal` CLI commands).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Enhance GraphManager with Healing Logic**
  - [x] Implement `coretext/core/graph/manager.py::prune_dangling_edges()`
    - [x] Query: `DELETE FROM edge WHERE in = NONE OR out = NONE` (or SurrealQL equivalent checking existence).
    - [x] Query: `DELETE FROM edge WHERE in.id IS NULL OR out.id IS NULL` (Verify SurrealQL behavior for deleted nodes).
  - [x] Implement `coretext/core/graph/manager.py::prune_orphan_headers()`
    - [x] Logic: Remove Header nodes that no longer have a `CONTAINS` relationship from a File node.
- [x] **Implement Startup Routine**
  - [x] Create `coretext/core/system/maintenance.py` (or keep in `graph/maintenance.py`) to coordinate these checks.
  - [x] Add async task in `coretext/server/app.py` startup event.
  - [x] Ensure it runs *after* the initial DB connection is established.
- [x] **Logging & Telemetry**
  - [x] Log count of removed items.
  - [x] Log warnings if an unusually high number of items (>1000) are pruned (potential data loss indicator).
- [x] **Unit & Integration Tests**
  - [x] Test: Create a graph with intentional dangling edges (delete a node without deleting edges).
  - [x] Run healing.
  - [x] Assert edges are gone.

## Dev Notes

- **SurrealDB Behavior**: When a node is deleted in SurrealDB, edges connected to it might remain as "ghost" edges depending on how the deletion happened (record deletion vs graph relational integrity). SurrealDB does *not* strictly enforce referential integrity by default unless `ON DELETE CASCADE` is defined in schema.
- **Schema Strategy**: Since we are using "Schema Projection" (Pydantic models), we might not have `DEFINE FIELD ... ON DELETE CASCADE` in the DB. Explicit cleanup is safer.
- **Query Pattern**:
  ```sql
  -- Find edges where start or end doesn't exist
  SELECT * FROM edge WHERE out IS NULL OR in IS NULL;
  -- or
  DELETE edge WHERE out = NONE OR in = NONE;
  ```
  *Verify exact SurrealQL syntax for checking existence of linked record.*

### Project Structure Notes

- **Module**: `coretext/core/graph/` is the right place for the logic.
- **Service**: `coretext/server/app.py` for the trigger.

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented `prune_dangling_edges` in `GraphManager` using dynamic schema inspection to find edge tables.
- Implemented `prune_orphan_headers` in `GraphManager`.
- Created `MaintenanceService` in `coretext/core/system/maintenance.py` to orchestrate healing and logging.
- Integrated maintenance task into `coretext/server/app.py` startup lifespan (async background task).
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/core/graph/test_manager_healing.py` and `tests/unit/core/system/test_maintenance.py`.
- Added integration test `tests/integration/test_healing_integration.py` (skipped if DB not available).
- [Fix] Updated `prune_dangling_edges` to use `out.id IS NONE` for proper ghost edge detection.
- [Fix] Updated `app.py` to use `load_config()` for DB connection details instead of hardcoded strings.
- [Fix] Updated unit tests to validate correct dereferencing SQL syntax.
