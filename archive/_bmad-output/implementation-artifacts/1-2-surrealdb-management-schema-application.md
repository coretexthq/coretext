# Story 1.2: SurrealDB Management & Schema Application

Status: done

## Story

As a `coretext` system,
I want to manage a local SurrealDB instance and apply the graph schema automatically,
so that the knowledge graph has a persistent and structured storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the `coretext` project is initialized
2. When `coretext init` is executed
3. Then the platform-specific `surreal` binary is downloaded to `~/.coretext/bin/`.
4. And a `surreal.db` file is created or found in `.coretext/` (in the project root).
5. And the user is prompted to start the daemon immediately ("Do you want to start the coretext daemon now? [Y/n]").
6. And on daemon startup, the SurrealDB schema (defined by Pydantic models mapped via `schema_map.yaml`) is automatically applied.
7. And `GraphManager` class is implemented to be the sole gatekeeper for DB writes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement `coretext/db/client.py` for SurrealDB connection and binary management (AC 3, 4)
  - [x] Implement download logic for platform-specific `surreal` binary
  - [x] Implement process management to start/stop SurrealDB
- [x] Implement `coretext/db/migrations.py` for schema definition (AC 5)
  - [x] Define SurrealQL schema definitions for nodes and edges
  - [x] Implement logic to apply schema on startup
- [x] Implement Pydantic models for Graph Entities (AC 5)
  - [x] Create `coretext/core/graph/models.py` with `Node`, `Edge` base classes
- [x] Implement `coretext/core/graph/manager.py` (AC 6)
  - [x] Implement `GraphManager` class pattern
  - [x] Implement basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Implement `schema_map.yaml` loading logic (AC 5)
  - [x] Create default `schema_map.yaml` in `.coretext/`
  - [x] Implement parser to map BMAD concepts to DB schema
- [x] Update `coretext/cli/commands.py` to include `init` and `start` logic (AC 2, 5)
  - [x] Add `start` command to CLI (daemon management)
  - [x] Update `init` command to prompt user to start daemon
  - [x] Implement `coretext start` logic (detached subprocess)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Patterns and Constraints

*   **Database:** SurrealDB (Local-first, Embedded). NO Docker.
*   **Binary Management:** `coretext init` must download the binary to `~/.coretext/bin/` (User Home).
*   **Data Storage:** `surreal.db` must be stored in `.coretext/` (Project Root).
*   **Schema Strategy:** "Schema Projection". Decoupled internal Pydantic models <-> `schema_map.yaml`.
*   **Access Control:** `GraphManager` class is the ONLY place where DB writes happen.
*   **Naming:** `snake_case` for DB tables/fields. `PascalCase` for Pydantic models.
*   **Async:** All DB operations must be `async/await`.
*   **Type Safety:** Strict Pydantic v2 usage (`model_validate`).
*   **IPC:** Daemon manages the SurrealDB process.

### Source Tree Components to Touch

*   `coretext/db/client.py` (NEW)
*   `coretext/db/migrations.py` (NEW)
*   `coretext/db/__init__.py`
*   `coretext/core/graph/manager.py` (NEW)
*   `coretext/core/graph/models.py` (NEW)
*   `coretext/core/graph/__init__.py`
*   `coretext/cli/commands.py` (Update for `init`)
*   `.coretext/schema_map.yaml` (NEW)
*   `tests/unit/core/graph/test_manager.py` (NEW)
*   `tests/unit/db/test_client.py` (NEW)

### Testing Standards Summary

*   **Mocking:** Mock the `surreal` binary download and process start for unit tests.
*   **Integration:** Use `pytest-asyncio` for DB tests.
*   **Safety:** Ensure tests do not overwrite the user's actual `~/.coretext/` data or project `.coretext/` data (use temp dirs).

### Project Structure Notes

*   **User Config:** `~/.coretext/` (Home directory) stores the binary and global config.
*   **Project Config:** `.coretext/` (Project root) stores `surreal.db` and `schema_map.yaml`.
*   **Conflicts:** Ensure that the local `.coretext` folder is git-ignored (except maybe config/schema if meant to be shared, but DB definitely ignored). The `schema_map.yaml` should probably be committed if it's part of the project def, but `surreal.db` should be in `.gitignore`.

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented SurrealDB client for binary management and process control.
- Implemented SchemaManager with dynamic schema application from YAML.
- Implemented GraphManager and Pydantic models.
- Implemented CLI commands for `init` and `apply-schema`.
- **Code Review Fixes (2025-12-10):**
  - Refactored `SchemaManager` to dynamically define fields from `schema_map.yaml`.
  - Added retry logic to `apply_schema` command to prevent race conditions.
  - Moved default schema content to `coretext/core/parser/schema.py`.
  - Fixed unit tests for migrations and CLI commands.
  - Added module and class docstrings to `models.py`.
  - Added conditional integration test `tests/integration/test_db_integration.py`.
- **Code Review Fixes (2025-12-12):**
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** Implemented automatic schema application in `init`/`start` command flow to satisfy AC6.
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** Resolved authentication errors by switching from deprecated `file:` storage to `rocksdb:` and handling unauthenticated local mode correctly for initial startup.
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** Implemented PID file management in `SurrealDBClient` and `start` command to prevent multiple daemon instances and lock conflicts.
  - **Performance:** Refactored `GraphManager.ingest` to use batched transactions (`BEGIN TRANSACTION ... COMMIT TRANSACTION`) for O(1) database round-trips per batch instead of O(N).
  - **Code Quality:** Removed duplicated type mapping logic in `migrations.py`.
  - **Testing:** Un-skipped and fixed CLI unit tests by handling `CliRunner` async incompatibility via synchronous test wrappers.
